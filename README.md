## Gameplay

You play as "Not Mario", a completely original character. To complete the game, you must move through the level, either avoiding enemies or jumping on their heads to defeat them. Along the way, collect coins for extra points and jump into item blocks to receive additional coins, watches, or pumpkins. Watches will grant you additional time to complete the level, while pumpkins will allow you to shoot a fireball which can be used to defeat the enemy. Reach the goal flag at the end to complete the level with as much score as possible!
